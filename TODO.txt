VISUAL
- add a few pixels of space at the top
- make bottom right status box transparent and change text colors

- status bar:
	- make file names same off buffer as on buffer
	- add lua_line_b for git status (make grey)
	- have round corners for bar
	- bar should not cover blank space, should only have a solid background behind text like file name, line numbers, and mode.
		- this means the bar will split in the middle

TEXT
- make stuff like int, void, a purple color (refer to how C code looks)
- find another color for functions, something more pink
	- turn properties/fields to a lighter pink if so
- make (*) same color as string when it's for pointer
- make (&) same color as string when it's for address

KEYMAPS:
- multivisual
	- change select all from <leader>a to <leader>aa
	- set '<leader>a + n' to select matches downwards

		- set 'b' during upwards/downwards matching as discard recent match and jump to next upwards/dowanrds
