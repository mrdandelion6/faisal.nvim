VISUAL
- add a few pixels of space at the top
- make bottom right status box transparent and change text colors

- status bar:
	- display N, I, R, V for mode, not "Normal" or "Visual"
	- make N accent teal
	- make I accent pink
	- make R accent light red
	- make V accent light blue
	- have round corners for bar
	- bar should not cover blank space, should only have a solid background behind text like file name, line numbers, and mode.
		- this means the bar will split in the middle
	- for terminal views, have $ path/of/term/pwd

TEXT
- make stuff like int, void, a purple color (refer to how C code looks)
- find another color for functions, something more pink
	- turn properties/fields to a lighter pink if so
- make (*) same color as string when it's for pointer
- make (&) same color as string when it's for address

KEYMAPS:
- multivisual
	- change select all from <leader>a to <leader>aa
